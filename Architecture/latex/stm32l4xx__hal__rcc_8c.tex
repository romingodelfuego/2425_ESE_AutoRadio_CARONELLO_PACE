  [..]
    After reset the device is running from Multiple Speed Internal oscillator
    (4 MHz) with Flash 0 wait state. Flash prefetch buffer, D-Cache
    and I-Cache are disabled, and all peripherals are off except internal
    SRAM, Flash and JTAG.

    (+) There is no prescaler on High speed (AHBs) and Low speed (APBs) busses:
        all peripherals mapped on these busses are running at MSI speed.
    (+) The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
    (+) All GPIOs are in analog mode, except the JTAG pins which
        are assigned to be used for debug purpose.

  [..]
    Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:
    (+) Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
        (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
    (+) Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings
    (+) Configure the AHB and APB busses prescalers
    (+) Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
    (+) Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals which clocks are not
        derived from the System clock (SAIx, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDMMC1/RNG)\end{DoxyVerb}
